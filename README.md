# Life Game

Long, long time ago in far galaxy... ops ;)

I remember like long time ago I tried to play [Life Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) on piece of paper sheet. It was fine game.
But... it take to much time. Today we can simulate this easy and fast.

It is my short approach to it.
